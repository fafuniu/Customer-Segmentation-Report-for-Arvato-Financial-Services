## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There is no necessary libraries to run the code in thie repo beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Motivation

This project is related to demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany. We aim to use both unsupervised learning and supervised learning to tell the difference between the general population and mail-order customers.   

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebooks in the root directory. It follows the traditional steps of data analyzing work-flow, and cover the following contents:
- Data description

- Supervised learning

The data file of this project is not provided because of the sensitive and proprietary nature of the demographics data.
